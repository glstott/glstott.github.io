===============

Howdy, and thanks for visiting! I am a PhD student at the University of Georgia Institute of Bioinformatics working in [Dr. Justin Bahl's Lab](https://vet.uga.edu/person/justin-bahl/). My research centers on human pathogen phylodynamics. Before arriving at UGA, I earned a Masters of Statistics degree at NC State University in Raleigh, NC and a B.S. degree in Mathematics at Clemson University in Clemson, SC. I spent a few years as a data scientist at TIAA, a financial services company, where I explored survival models for understanding customer experience, graph databases for a variety of projects including ETL consolidation and client retention modeling, and machine learning models for prospect identification (among other things, but those are my favorites!). While at TIAA, I helped design an enterprise-wide course on data science fundamentals, hosted bootcamps for using Python for data analysis, and, with my colleagues, put on several workshops around machine learning topics for University of NC at Charlotte's Data Science Masters students.

My research so far has been developing pipelines for phylogenetics generating graph database tools, optimal subsampling for phylogenetics, and HPAI spread on larger timescales. Feel free to reach out if you have a fun project you'd like to discuss; I'm always looking for more projects to keep me busy and love a good chat.
