The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the difficulty in integrating disparate data sources for epidemiologic surveillance. To address this challenge, we have created a graph database to integrate phylogenetic trees, associated metadata, and community surveillance data for phylodynamic inference. As an example use case, we divided 22,713 SARS-CoV-2 samples into 5 groups, generated maximum likelihood trees, and inferred a potential transmission network from a forest of minimum spanning trees built on patristic distances between samples. We then used Cytoscape to visualize the resultant graphs.
